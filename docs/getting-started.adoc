deejx lets you control application volume levels using physical sliders. It works by reading analog input from a microcontroller and sending it to a desktop app that controls audio output in real time.

== Requirements

* Linux, Windows 10 or later
* A microcontroller (Arduino or ESP32)
* 1â€“10 sliders (potentiometers or faders)
* Basic wiring (breadboard, jumper wires)
* Arduino IDE or compatible

== Choose Your Platform

This fork supports two types of microcontrollers:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Arduino (e.g. Nano, Uno) | ESP32 (e.g. DevKit, WROOM)

| 6â€“8 analog pins (A0â€“A5)
| More analog pins available (GPIO 32â€“39 etc.)

| 5V operation
| 3.3V operation (double-check voltage compatibility)
|===

== Choose Your Setup

Follow the instructions for your board type:
