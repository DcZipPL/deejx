This guide explains how to set up deejx with an ESP32 with a simple browser-based flasher.

== 1. Hardware Wiring

* Connect 1â€“10 sliders to analog-capable GPIO pins (e.g., GPIO34, GPIO35, GPIO32...).
* Use a breadboard or custom PCB.
* Power all sliders from *3.3V* (not 5V!) and GND on the ESP32.

== 2. Flashing the Firmware

This fork uses a web-based flasher for ease of use â€” no IDE required.

. Visit the firmware flashing page:  
  ðŸ‘‰ link:https://prefex.dev/flash/deejx[Flash Firmware]
. Connect your ESP32 via USB.
. Click *"Connect"* and select your device.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to flash the latest firmware.
. Wait for confirmation â€” your device will reboot and begin running deej firmware.

NOTE: Use Chrome or Edge for best compatibility with Web Serial API.

== 3. Desktop App Configuration

Define your slider mappings:

[source,yaml]
----
mappings:
  - pin: 35 # Pin of ESP32
    master: 0 # Change master volume
    inverted: false # Is slider inverted
  - pin: 34
    app: "spotify" # Change app volume
    inverted: false
  - pin: 33
    midi: 10 # Midi value
    inverted: false
----

For detailed how to map apps or devices see: ðŸ‘‰ link:../configuration-file.adoc[Configuration File]

== 4. Run deej

. Ensure your ESP32 is powered.
. Launch `deej.exe` on Windows or `./deej` on Linux.
. You should see volume changes in real time when moving sliders.

== Troubleshooting

* No response from sliders? Confirm correct GPIO mapping in firmware.
* Still stuck? Try re-flashing the firmware or restarting the ESP32.
