# process names are case-insensitive
# you can use 'master' to indicate the master channel with device index.
# you can use 'app' to control a process with the certain name.
# you can use 'midi' to control a virtual midi device with an index.
# not providing any of options will result in "unmapped" control.
# Unmapped controls all apps that aren't bound to any slider (this ignores master, mic and device-targeting sessions)
# Per mapping you need to set pin that is used esp32/arduino and of it is inverted
mappings:
  - pin: 35
    master: 0
    inverted: false
  - pin: 34
    app: "spotify"
    inverted: false
  - pin: 33
    midi: 10
    inverted: false
  - pin: 32
    inverted: false

# adjust the amount of signal noise reduction depending on your hardware quality
# supported values are "high" (excellent hardware), "default" (regular hardware) or "low" (bad, noisy hardware)
